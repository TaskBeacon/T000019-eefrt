## Why These Papers

- `R1_TREADWAY_2009` is the canonical protocol source and defines the key design parameters:
  easy vs hard effort options, fixed easy reward, variable hard reward, and probability cue levels.
- `R2_OHMANN_2022` provides modern reliability evidence that the same core EEfRT design remains stable for measurement.
- `R3_TREADWAY_2012` supports translational validity and the primary behavioral endpoint (hard-option choice proportion).

## Protocol Decisions Anchored to References

- Choice options:
  easy = 30 presses in 7 seconds; hard = 100 presses in 21 seconds (`R1_TREADWAY_2009`).
- Reward structure:
  easy reward fixed at 1.00; hard reward sampled across a higher range (`R1_TREADWAY_2009`).
- Probability cueing:
  12%, 50%, 88% win-probability levels (`R1_TREADWAY_2009`, `R2_OHMANN_2022`).
- Primary metrics:
  hard-choice rate, effort-completion rate, and earned reward (`R1_TREADWAY_2009`, `R3_TREADWAY_2012`).
